# Advent2024
Advent of Code in Swift. I created an app just for fun. 2 tabs (1 to show solutions, and the other to show the current day's puzzle).

To complete this yourself you'll have to go into the advent of code and get your own data set. Rename the data sets to day1.txt, day2.txt and move them into your bundle for it to work!
